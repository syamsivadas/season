<p>Odette LaMar, better known as the Aglaeca, is a character in The CW 2019 Nancy Drew television series. She was once a French heiress who was executed for her money. Her execution turned into a vengeful sea spirit, with groups of young adults calling on her for favors. She demands a toll in exchange for her favor, but if they fail to pay it, she kills them after seven days of portents.</p><br>

<p>As a human, Odette was a beautiful young woman with long blonde hair, pale skin, and blue eyes. She wore beautiful expensive jewels and dresses to reflect her wealth. She was slender and had an oval-shaped face.</p>
<p>As a spirit called the Aglaeca, her appearance is drastically different. She is a vaguely-humanoid sea creature with webbed hands and a tail that resembles a mermaid. She has pure white eyes and wears rope around her torso that attaches to chains, which reflects how she was murdered. Her skin is relatively gone, showing the outline of her skull. She has elongated canine teeth and white, sparse hair that is cut in uneven patches. The Aglaeca also appears to have horns sprouting from her skull in the shape of a crown.</p></font><br>
<hr><font face="times new roman" size="6" color="black">History</font><hr>
<font face="verdana" size="4" color="white"><p>Odette LaMar was wealthy heiress from France, who learned that the soil around the LaMar land was right for vineyards. She turned her family holdings into a prosperous olive oil business. In her later years, she wrote secret yet beautiful love letters to an English woman. She also posed for a portrait with her favorite ruby necklace. Odette eventually boarded a ship to America called "The Governance", where she met Captain Douglas Marvin, who learned of her wealth. He coveted her wealth and decided to murder her to obtain it. He partnered with his friend Reverend Hudson in the scheme. Together, they murdered Odette while she was aboard, shaving her head and sacrificing her to the sea. Odette's death was painful as seaweed wrapped around he throat and she eventually drowned. The men, however, forged a marriage certificate that used Odette's wealth to found Horseshoe Bay.</p>
<p>
They crafted a story that Odette had a whirlwind romance with Captain Marvin leading to their impulsive married. She than tragically died of consumption, known later as tuberculosis, before they reached land. Odette was recorded in history and remembered by her peers in this manner. Captain Marvin stole Odette's belongings, including her favored ruby necklace, and regifted them to his second wife Agnes Marvin. The violence of Odette's death and the betrayal she suffered turned her into a vengeful sea spirit. She shed her human form in favor of a vicious sea creature that would later be called the Aglaeca.</p>
<p>
The Aglaeca became a local legend in Horseshoe Bay, Maine. She was first summoned by six women in white during the 1800's, one of which was a Hudson ancestor. The Agaleca is documented by the Historical Society, with only one publication linking the legend to a human instead of a creature. According to legend, people can summon the Aglaeca and ask her for anything they desire. When the wish is granted, the wisher's eyes bleed. While many residents have called on the creature in the past, none of their wishes were fulfilled.
</p><p>
She was summoned again in 1975 by a group of troubled young adults, led by John "Mac" MacDonald. Rita Howell, Javier Perez, Perry Barber, AJ Nashiyama and Autumn Curtis took part in the ritual. When they failed to pay her toll, the Aglaeca came for each of their lives. Mac came into possession of the Aglaeca's sea shanty on a vinyl 1945 record, which he believed would help free them from the curse. The record was stolen by Buddy, Mac's best friend, as collateral for an unpaid bar tab. Mac killed Buddy who refused to give up the location of the '45. On July 17, 1975, each of the five friends died violent and horrible deaths that were disguised as accidents. The record holding the sea shanty was seemingly lost.</p>
<p>
The sixth member of the group, AJ, survived the Aglaeca's wrath. He fled Horseshoe Bay to New Orleans, where he found an ancient talisman which has the mark of the bhoot engraved on it. The talisman attracts malevolent spirits and draws the most viscous and Evil spirits in the area to the holder. He uses the talisman to deter the Aglaeca, managing to survive forty-five years without falling victim to her.</p>
