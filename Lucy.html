<p>Lucy was a beautiful young woman with wavy, shoulder-length blonde hair and big hazel eyes. She had a slim build and quiet demeanor after the months of bullying she was subjected too.

They had a tendency to occasionally meet up with each other and go to their "Spot " which was later shown to be the local ice cream shop prior to her death. Her mental health suffered after Ryan's parents spread rumors about her and Patrice lost her job at The Claw which is highly indicated she blamed Lucy for it.</p>
