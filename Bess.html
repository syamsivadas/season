<p>Bess Turani was born in the poor town of Tower Hamlets, London, England.[1] She grew up with little means but envied the rich lifestyle of those she saw around her. Her mother, Regina Turani, used to tell Bess stories about a rich American family named the Marvin's who lived in Horseshoe Bay, Maine. Regina claimed to be the long-lost daughter of a Marvin, who was exiled by the family after she married Bess' father - a man of lower class than the Marvin's. However, their marriage didnâ€™t last long as he soon left the family. When Bess turned eighteen, she flew to America to determine if the stories her mother told about the wealthy Marvin's were true or not. She struck up the alias of "Bess Marvin" and fronted as the visiting niece of Diana Marvin, though she secretly lived in a van and waited tables at The Claw.</p>
<p>In her drafted obituary, Bess wrote, "A true rags to riches story...Her humble story began as a daughter to a single-mother. Bess spent her early years struggling to help keep a leaky roof over heads and tea and Marm in the cupboard. Bess almost accepted that this would be her life, even though she always believed she was meant for something more. Through a twist of fate, Bess discovered she had long, lost dear relatives in the States. The magnanimous Marvins. Bess' heart urged her to reconnect with this side of her family to get to know them and discover who she truly was and who she was truly meant to be. With her indomitable, fearless spirit, Bess took action..."</p></font><br>
