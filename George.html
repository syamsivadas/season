<p>George is officially described as "Nancy's nemesis from high school."George is a hard worker and goal-oriented when it relates to her job at The Claw; this stems from her role of breadwinner to her family, having to care for her sisters and alcoholic mother. Despite having a 'tough-as-nails' demeanor, George can be vulnerable when personal issues arise in her life, such as her affair with an older, married man and shame for her mother's behavior. She is also fiercely protective, becoming quite hysterical and infuriated when she realized that her sister Ted, had been kidnapped.</p></font><br>

<font face="verdana" size="4" color="black"><p>George is the eldest daughter of Horseshoe Bay's resident clairvoyant, Victoria Fan. George is the sister of Jessie, Ted, and Charlie. Her superstitious mother used to sprinkle salt around her high-chair, presumably to ward off evil spirits. She attended high school with Nancy Drew, though they found themselves on opposite ends of the social network. Nancy's friends used to gossip about George and create rumors about her romantic life, while Nancy did nothing to stop their actions. A deep resentment seeded on George's part. In her junior year of high school, George met the married millionaire playboy Ryan Hudson. The pair developed a secret affair that they kept from everyone, including Ryan's wife Tiffany. Their relationship was on and off again with them eventually taking a break due to George being in high school. She went on to both manage and wait tables at The Claw, where she became known for her tough-as-nails attitude and dedication to her work.</p>
